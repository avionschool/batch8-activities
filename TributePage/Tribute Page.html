            <h3>Quick facts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Lord Byron was her father. Although Ada Lovelace was English poet Lord George Gordon Byron’s only legitimate child, he was hardly an exemplary father. </p></li>

            <li><p>The “father of the computer” was her mentor. At the age of 17, Lovelace met inventor and mathematician Charles Babbage and watched him demonstrate a model portion of his difference engine.</p></li>
            <li><p>She was a visionary who predicted that computers could do more than just crunch numbers.</p></li>
            <li><p>She was a compulsive gambler.</p></li>
