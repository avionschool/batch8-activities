- 
- Create a function addBook() that creates a book object (with title , quantity and value ) and add it to an array of book
objects in the store inventory
- Create a function restockBook() that takes the parameters title and quantity and adds the corresponding book to the
inventory. The book should already exist in the inventory, if not, restock should not push thru.
- Create a function sellBook() that takes the parameter title and quantity . When called, it searches for the book with
the corresponding title, deducts the quantity, and adds the earnings accordingly
- If the book does not exist, transaction will fail then print a message ${book-title} out of stock .
- If quantity is less than what is in the inventory, transaction will fail then print message only ${number} stocks left
- If sell was successful, print message "Successful transaction".
- Create a function totalEarnings() that will display the total earnings of the store, print store name and earnings;
- Create a function listInventory() that will display all of books in the inventory, print title quantity and value;-->
