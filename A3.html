        <h2 id="img-caption">American actor and producer</h2>

        <p id="tribute-info">
            His career has been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of
            substance abuse and legal troubles,
            before a resurgence of commercial success in middle age.
            In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world,
            and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.
            His films have grossed over $14.4 billion worldwide, making Downey the sixth-highest-grossing box office
            star of all-time.

        <h3>1996–2001: Career troubles</h3>
        <p>From 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested numerous times on charges related to drugs including cocaine,
            heroin, and marijuana and went through drug treatment programs unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a
            judge:
            "It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the
            gun metal."
            He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, due to the fact
            that his father,
            also an addict previously, had been giving them to him.
        </p>

        <h3>2001–2007: Career comeback</h3>
        <p>After five years of substance abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was ready to work toward a full
            recovery from drugs and return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his addictive
            behavior in the
            past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should
            go to
            rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give
            it a
            shot." He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another
            stint in
            prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, "I said, 'You know what? I don't think
            I can
            continue doing this. And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a
            half-assed way and
            you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly
            ghastly problems ...
            what's hard is to decide to do it."
