TIC TAC TOE (5 DAYS)
Phase 1
• Create a game of tic tac toe.
• The design, representation and responsiveness of the tic tac toe board in the DOM is up to your creativity and imagination.
• The rule of whose turn it is (X or O) must be observed. You can choose whether X or O will play first.
• The "state" of the board should strictly come from a two-dimensional array (In JS, that's array within an array).
• You may use array built-in methods.

Phase 2
• When a player wins, you must show the history of the game.
• To do that, every move should be "saved".
• Implement two buttons, "Previous" and "Next", that will show up when a game is done/finished.
• When clicking previous or next, the board should show the current move at that moment/turn.
• If there's no "next move", the next button must be disabled. And if there's no "previous move", the previous button must be disabled.
• Also, implement a reset button, that:
    a. restarts the game
    b. hides the next and prev buttons
    c. clears move history
• Yes. Refreshing the page clears the history of the game.
• No. You cannot use any library like React etc. (You can check them as references though.)
• No. You cannot use class(objects). Let's be "functional" for now!
