<h1>Use CSS Reset to improve browser compatability</h1>
<br>
<p><strong>CSS Reset</strong><sup>[1]</sup> is a widely used practice whereby developers first use a primary .css file to "reset" styles applied by a browser and to ensure that they are back to "standard" before applying their own CSS style. This is because every browser has its own "default stylesheet" or "user agent stylesheet" and displays elements with slightly different spacing. 
By using a CSS Reset, you can ensure that your CSS styles will look the same regardless of a user's browser.</p>
